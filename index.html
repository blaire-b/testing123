    <h1>Github Pages is a good resource</h1>
    <p>I was wondering how people who are web developers make pages that don't require paying for hosting. This can be especially helpful when you are learning and would like to create a page, but don't want to pay for hosting each one. That would be crazy expensive.</p>
    <h3>Things I learned today:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How to create a repository</li>
      <li>Create a site on Github pages</li>
      <li>Navigate to the site with the assigned URL</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pretty cool indeed!</p>
